(1) Add tests to make sure consisten results are obtained (compare with standard Kalman filter)
(2) Clean up unneeded code 
(3) Consider modifying the Kalman gain for outliers (so that the uncertainty is accounted for in the covariance)
    -  Another strategy is to inflate the innovation covariance through a low rank update (all zeros except ith element)
    -  If error < ncutoff*stdev, use nominal, otherwise scale stdev it so that error = ncutoff*stdev
