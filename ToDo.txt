(1) Prepare for merging into Main 
    - Add tests to make sure consisten results are obtained (compare with standard Kalman filter)
    - Clean up unneeded/dead code
    - Add multithreading

(2) Consider more advanced outlier mitigation strategies that properly adust uncertainty
    -   One strategy is modifying the gain by (zc./z) where zc is the constrained innovation (as previously calculated)
        -   This will propagate this to the uncertainty
    -   Another strategy is to inflate the innovation covariance through a low rank update (all zeros except ith element)
        -   if error_ii > ncutoff*stdev_ii
        -       dvar_ii = error_ii^2 - (ncutoff*stdev_ii)^2
        -       lowrankupdate!(S, onehot(dvar_ii, ii)) #Ensure this results in chol_std(S, ii) == error_ii^2
